## About me

I'm an eletrical engineering major at South Alabama and currently in my junior year. I am from Gadsden Alabama and I played basketball and golf in high school, playinng in the state championship in golf. My hobbies include music, Game of Thrones, Destiny 2, tutoring, and sports. This may seem as a disappointment to some but I am a Tennessee fan.
